/* An array is a linear data structure that holds a collection of elements, all of the same data type, 
arranged in a sequential manner. 
Each element in an array is identified by an index or a key, allowing for efficient access and modification of data.
Arrays can contain elements of various data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. 

Dynamic Sizing: Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning their size can be adjusted at runtime.
Index-Based Access: Elements are accessed using numerical indices, starting from 0.
Flexible Element Types: Arrays can hold different types of elements simultaneously, such as numbers and strings.
