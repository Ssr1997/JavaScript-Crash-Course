Event propagation in JavaScript refers to the sequence in which an event moves through the Document Object Model (DOM) tree when an action, such as a user click, occurs. This process determines the order in which event handlers are executed on nested elements. Understanding event propagation is essential for effective event management in web development.

Phases of Event Propagation

Event propagation consists of three main phases:

Capturing Phase (Event Capturing): The event starts from the root of the DOM tree and travels down to the target element.
During this phase, event listeners set with the capture option as true are executed. 

Target Phase: The event reaches the target elementâ€”the element that triggered the event. 
Event listeners on the target element are executed during this phase, regardless of the capture parameter. 

Bubbling Phase (Event Bubbling): After reaching the target, the event propagates back up the DOM tree to the root.
Event listeners set with the capture option as false (or omitted) are executed during this phase.

  <title>Event Propagation Example</title>
  <style>
    .outer {
      padding: 20px;
      border: 2px solid blue;
    }
    .inner {
      padding: 20px;
      border: 2px solid green;
    }
    .target {
      padding: 20px;
      border: 2px solid red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="outer">
    Outer Div
    <div class="inner">
      Inner Div
      <button class="target">Click Me</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script>
    document.querySelector('.outer').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      console.log('Outer DIV Clicked');
    }, false); // Bubbling phase

    document.querySelector('.inner').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      console.log('Inner DIV Clicked');
    }, true); // Capturing phase

    document.querySelector('.target').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      console.log('Button Clicked');
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

Clicking the button will trigger three event listeners:

The inner div listener during the capturing phase.
The target button listener during the target phase.
The outer div listener during the bubbling phase.

Controlling Event Propagation :

To manage event propagation, JavaScript provides methods such as stopPropagation() and stopImmediatePropagation().

event.stopPropagation(): Stops the event from propagating further in the capturing and bubbling phases. 

event.stopImmediatePropagation(): Stops the event from propagating and prevents any remaining event listeners on the current target from being executed. 

Practical Application: Event Delegation

Event delegation leverages event propagation by allowing a single event listener on a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements. 
This approach enhances performance and simplifies code management.
